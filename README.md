Code to download transcripts and analyze the language used in them.

Motivation
----------
When listening to the radio, I noticed that at the end of a segment,
the host often thanks the guest or correspondent, who then usually
responds with something like "thank you" or "thank you for having me".
Occasionally, the response is "you're welcome" or "my pleasure" or
something in that vein.  But sometimes, the response is "you bet".
Once I thought about it, I don't know what "you bet" means or what
its origin is.

I had the idea of having code analyze transcripts of radio shows to
see what the distribution of these final responses are and how that
distribution changes over time.  I did nothing with this idea for
almost a decade, but it stayed in the back of my mind.

Now, I start writing the code to do it.
